    "text": "The energy-intensive industry (EII) in Europe has been facing significant challenges in recent years, particularly due to rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions (Draghi 2024). This has led to a noticeable decline in production levels within this sector compared to the broader manufacturing and services industries.\nTo illustrate these trends, we present a production index tracking the performance of key EII sectors within the European Union, following the Methodology by Vogel, Neumann, and Linz (2023).\nThe data for the index can be downloaded as a CSV here"

    "text": "The importance of energy-intensive industries\nEnergy-intensive sectors are a cornerstone of the European economy, playing an essential role in minimizing the EU’s reliance on external sources. These industries have a significant impact, both directly and through related downstream sectors, on the EU’s overall economic output, job creation, and innovation. Key examples include chemicals, basic metals, non-metallic minerals (such as ceramics, glass, and cement), plastics, paper, wood products, and food.\nThese 5 most energy intensive sectors—chemicals, basic metals, non-metallic minerals, paper, and printing—together represent a significant portion of the EU’s industrial output. According to Eurostat, these five industries account for 16.3% of total industrial production in the EU, highlighting their substantial energy usage.\nThe table below provides an overview of these sectors by NACE classification, including key examples of products and their share within the broader manufacturing sector:\n\nThe 5 most energy-intensive sectors in the EU in 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNACE Classification\nDescription\nExample Product\n% of Manufacturing Sector\n\n\n\n\nC17\nManufacture of paper and paper products\nCardboard Boxes\n2.1%\n\n\nC18\nPrinting and reproduction of recorded media\nNewspapers\n1.1%\n\n\nC20\nManufacture of chemicals and chemical products\nFertilisers\n6.5%\n\n\nC23\nManufacture of other non-metallic mineral products\nGlass\n3.4%\n\n\nC24\nManufacture of basic metals\nSteel\n3.1%\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n16.3%"

    "text": "Creating the Index\nThe industrial production index is calculated by weighting different economic indices based on their gross value added at factor cost in the base year, then combining them to form an aggregated index. Our method follows the one by Vogel, Neumann, and Linz (2023), who calculated an index for EII in Germany. In 2021, before the crisis hit, the manufacture of chemicals holds the largest share of industrial production and therefore receives the highest weighting among the five energy-intensive sectors.\nThe underlying code can be found here"

    "text": "The World Economic Forecasting Model (WEFM) was developed to allow the UN Development Policy Analysis Division to produce consistent forecasts for the global economy for use in its flagship publication, World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) and the WESP Update, and for the forecasts presented at annual meetings of Project LINK.\nThe WEFM evolved from the original Project LINK programme, which started in the 1960s, and linked together individual country macro-models from up to 80 different countries in order to compute a joint global forecast. The WEFM is also used to produce alternative scenarios around the central forecast. Examples include the impact of a resurgence in the euro area debt crisis; a sharp adjustment in global energy prices; a fiscal stimulus coordinated among the largest economies; migration flows in Europe; conventional and unconventional monetary policy shocks; and a slowdown in trend productivity growth. The flexible model platform can be adapted to address a wide range of policy questions.\nFurther Reading (PDF)"
